# Start
This is a tutorial about how to use the fperf command line. We will take the builtin testcase "http" as an example.

## Installing
`fperf` is developed in golang, make sure you have setup the go environment correctly.

then
```
go get github.com/fperf/fperf/bin/fperf
```

## Run benchmark
`fperf` in fact is a performance benchmark framework, you can use it to develop your own performance benchmark tools.
It has some demo implementation builtin including `http` and `grpc_testing`. We will take the `http` to
demonstrate how to use `fperf`

### Run by default
```
fperf http http://example.com
```

We call the `http` a testcase, `fperf` runs the testcase and pass an url to it. This will run the benchmark
with default fperf options(1 connection, 1 goroutine, no delay)

### Run by concurrency
```
fperf -cpu 8 -connection 100 -goroutine 2 -tick 1s http http://example.com
```
```
-cpu :set the GOMAXPROCS witch better be the number of core of cpu
-connection : the number of the connection
-goroutine : the number of goroutine per connection, so we have 200 concurrent goroutines in this example
-ticks : the interval between output and statistics
```

The result:
```

The result has two parts. The first part show the latency and qps witch will be printed
every <tick> time. The second part shows the histogram of latency. This will be outputed
only when you terminate fperf.
